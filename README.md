This is the repo for the "Advanced Topics in Machine Learning" course

This project concerns Multi-Label genre classification from book descriptions using various Multi-Label Learning techniques such as:
- Binary Relevance
- Classifier Chains
- Label Powersets
- Deep Learning

Futhermore, the problem of class imbalance is adressed using different methods.
Finally, we explore multiple Active Learning approaches to simulate a real world NLP problem where labeled data are often not available and their manual annotation is difficult and time consuming.

### Dependencies
In order to reproduce this project it is highly recommended to create a new Python 3 virtual env and install packages from requirements.txt file
```sh
python3 -m venv advanced_ml_venv
source advanced_ml_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
